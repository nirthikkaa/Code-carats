# Foundly

Lost and found web app with secure, confidence-based item matching.

**Live demo:** foundly.up.railway.app

## What it does

Foundly lets users submit lost item reports through a public form. A private admin inventory of found items is cross-referenced using a keyword similarity algorithm (Jaccard scoring). Item details are never exposed publicly — only after a high-confidence match is confirmed by an admin does the user receive a claim code to retrieve their item.

**User flow:**
1. User submits a lost item report with description, category, color, and location
2. System scores the report against the private found inventory
3. If a match is found above the confidence threshold, the admin is notified
4. Admin reviews, approves or rejects the match
5. On approval, user receives a claim code to pick up their item

**Admin flow:**
- Register found items into the private inventory
- View and filter the inventory
- Review potential matches scored by the system
- Approve or reject matches and issue claim codes

## Running locally

```bash
cd src/backend
npm install
node server.js
```

Open `http://localhost:5050` in your browser.

**Default admin password:** `foundly-admin-2026`

To change it, set the environment variable:
```bash
ADMIN_TOKEN=your-secure-password node server.js
```

## Matching algorithm

Each lost report is scored against every found item in the private inventory using a weighted Jaccard similarity across four dimensions:

| Signal | Max points |
|---|---|
| Category match | 30 |
| Color match | 20 |
| Location similarity | 20 |
| Description / name / brand overlap | 25 |
| Date proximity | 10 |

A score of 60+ surfaces the match for admin review. A score of 80+ is flagged as high confidence.
