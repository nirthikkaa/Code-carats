# LOST & FOUND ITEM MATCHER
This project allows users to submit lost items securely. The system compares submissions against a private inventory of found items, surfaces high-confidence matches to authorized assistants. The primary goal is to eliminate manual searching and prevent false claims by ensuring the inventory remains invisble until a high-confidence match is confirmed.

# Features:

-->Submit lost item via text description + optional photo
-->Track status of submitted inquiry
-->Privacy-first: inventory never visible

Assistant Side:
-->Upload found items (text + photo) in the private data base
-->Approve/reject matches given by the system
